# Loca-ping

App that pings device current location and sends to to back-end. 
- Used only for research purposes
- Uses push notifications to "wake up" and send location
- Uses foreground service to periodically get new location and send it
- Supporting back-end: https://github.com/marius-m/app-ping

- ! Does not include `google-services.json`, that push notification service needs
